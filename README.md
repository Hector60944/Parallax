# Parallax
A moderation bot for Discord!

Note that the code provided is for educational purposes only. I will not assist you in setting up your own instance of Parallax.
Additionally, if you fork this repository or host your own instance, you must ensure the code is public and you state any changes made to the code. See the license for more information.

Additionally, public instances* are strongly discouraged and will be reported if seen. If you insist on hosting Parallax for public consumption, take the code you need and make meaningful modifications, don't host the entire bot or change the embed colours and response text. That is **not** a meaningful change and will most likely get your bot reported.

*public instance - A bot not intended for private/personal use; one that is usable by the public.
