# Parallax
A moderation bot for Discord!

Parallax's code is offered for eductional purposes only. Assistance in self-hosting is not offered, and hosting for public consumption is strongly discouraged. If you decide to fork Parallax, please ensure your code is public and you state any changes made. Refer to the license for additional information.

Additionally, public instances* will be reported if seen. If you insist on hosting Parallax for public consumption, take the code you need and make meaningful modifications, don't host the entire bot or change the embed colours and response text. That is **not** a meaningful change and will most likely get your bot reported.

*public instance - A bot not intended for private/personal use; one that is usable by the public.
